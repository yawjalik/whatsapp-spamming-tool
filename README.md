# whatsapp-spamming-tool

Basic command line spamming tool for WhatsApp Web using Selenium.

How to use:

1. Look at the inp_xpath = '//div[@class="_1awRl copyable-text selectable-text"][@contenteditable="true"][@data-tab="6"]' which is basically the location of the text input.
So different browsers have different IDs or something like that idk. 

2. You gotta inspect element and change the _1awR1 (and @data-tab="some number") to your browser's one.
Other than that it should work.

Make sure the name you input is exactly the same as how it appears on your whatsapp.

USE RESPONSIBLY
